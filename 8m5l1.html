    <h3>Lesson 5.1: Foundations of Practical Psychology – What Drives Human Behavior</h3>
    <p>Understanding why people act the way they do is the cornerstone of practical psychology.</p>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: The Basics of Human Behavior</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Human behavior refers to the range of actions and mannerisms exhibited by people, influenced by their emotions, personality, and environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    Think of human behavior as the “software” running in the human brain, guiding decisions, interactions, and reactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Elements:</strong><br>
    Personality Traits: (Consistent characteristics that define how we behave, such as extraversion or introversion.)<br>
    Motivation: The driving force behind our actions (e.g., the need for success, love, or security).</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
    Two colleagues might react very differently in a stressful meeting—one might speak up confidently (possibly high in extraversion), while the other might stay quiet (possibly more introverted). Their underlying personalities and motivations explain these differences.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine two smartphones with different operating systems. Although both perform similar tasks, their interfaces and responses differ because of the “software” (personality) installed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: The Role of the Brain in Behavior</h4>
    <p><strong>Brain Basics:</strong><br>
    Our brain is the control center for behavior. Key areas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Limbic System: Processes emotions (e.g., the amygdala acts as an alarm system when danger is sensed).</li>
      <li>The Prefrontal Cortex: Handles decision-making and impulse control (acting like a CEO who plans and directs actions).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong><br>
    When you experience an emotion—say, excitement—a burst of chemicals (like dopamine, associated with reward) is released, influencing your subsequent actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of your brain as a well-coordinated company. Different departments (brain regions) work together to ensure that your “operations” (behavior) run smoothly. Understanding this helps explain why, for example, a stressful event might lead to hasty decisions.</p>
