    <h3>Lesson 2.1: Sociology – Social Structures &amp; Dynamics</h3>
    <p>Sociology is the study of how societies are organized and how people interact within them. It examines the patterns, systems, and relationships that shape our social world.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Sociology?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Sociology is the study of society, social behavior, and the structures that organize our interactions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      Think of sociology as learning about the “rules of the game” that people play in society.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a large sports team where every player has a role and position. Sociology looks at how these roles and interactions help the team (society) work together.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: Social Structures</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Social structures are the organized patterns of relationships and institutions that form the basis of society.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Components:</strong><br>
      Institutions: (Stable systems or patterns such as family, education, religion, and government that shape behavior.)<br>
      Social Roles: (Expectations for behavior based on one’s position in society, like the role of a teacher or a parent.)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      In a school, the institution of education sets up a system where teachers impart knowledge and students learn, while roles define what is expected of each group. Teachers are expected to guide and educate, and students are expected to learn and respect the rules.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of social structures like the framework of a building. Just as a building relies on beams and columns for support, society relies on institutions and roles to provide stability and order.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Social Dynamics</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Social dynamics refer to the forces and processes that change social structures over time, such as social movements, trends, and conflicts.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong><br>
      These dynamics include changes in culture, shifts in power among different groups, and evolving social norms. They help explain how societies transform and adapt.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
      The civil rights movement in the United States was a powerful social dynamic that changed laws and social attitudes, leading to greater equality.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a river that slowly changes its course over time. Social dynamics are like the water that reshapes the riverbanks (social structures), sometimes causing significant changes in the landscape.
