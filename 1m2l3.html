    <h3>Lesson 2.3: Introduction to Proof Techniques</h3>
    <p>Proofs are the heart and soul of mathematics. They provide the rigorous backbone that confirms our ideas are not just plausible, but indisputably true (within the given assumptions).</p>
    
    <h4>What Is a Proof?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A proof is a logical argument that uses accepted facts, definitions, and previously proven statements to demonstrate that a mathematical statement is true.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Proofs ensure that mathematical truths are reliable and universal, turning conjectures into established facts.</p>
    
    <h4>Common Proof Techniques</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Direct Proof:</strong> Start with known facts and follow logical steps to reach the conclusion.  
        <em>Example:</em> To prove that the sum of two even numbers is even, let the numbers be <code>2a</code> and <code>2b</code>. Then, <code>2a + 2b = 2(a+b)</code>, which is even.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Proof by Contradiction:</strong> Assume the opposite of what you want to prove, demonstrate that this assumption leads to a contradiction, and conclude the original statement must be true.  
        <em>Example:</em> To prove that √2 is irrational, assume it is rational. This assumption eventually contradicts the fundamental properties of numbers.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Proof by Mathematical Induction:</strong> Prove a base case, then show that if a statement holds for an arbitrary case <code>n</code>, it holds for <code>n+1</code>.  
        <em>Example:</em> To prove that the sum of the first <code>n</code> natural numbers is <code>n(n+1)/2</code>, first verify it for <code>n = 1</code>, then assume it holds for <code>n = k</code> and prove it for <code>k+1</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Introducing a New Concept: Counterexample</h4>
    <p><strong>Counterexample:</strong> An example that disproves a statement by showing a single case where it fails.  
      <em>Example:</em> The statement “All prime numbers are odd” is disproved by the counterexample <code>2</code>, which is prime but even.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Why Learning Proof Techniques Is Crucial</h4>
    <p>Proof techniques not only confirm mathematical truths but also sharpen your critical thinking. They teach you to reason step by step and leave no room for error—skills highly valued in every scientific field.</p>
    
    <h4>Fun Analogy</h4>
    <p>Imagine proving something as a detective solving a mystery. Every clue (fact or theorem) is examined, and every suspect (assumption) is questioned, until only the truth remains. Proofs are your magnifying glass and fingerprint kit in this intellectual investigation!</p>
    
    <h4>Module Summary</h4>
    <p>In this module, you’ve acquired essential mathematical concepts that are the building blocks for more advanced topics. Set theory and notation provide the language, functions, relations, and sequences show you how elements interact and change, and proof techniques confirm your insights with rigorous logic. Keep these core ideas handy—they’re your passport to exploring deeper realms of mathematics!</p>
