    <h3>Lesson 2.3: Animal Nutrition &amp; Health</h3>
    <p>Animal nutrition and health are critical components of livestock management. In this lesson, we discuss how proper feeding, balanced diets, and health practices ensure the well-being and productivity of farm animals.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: Fundamentals of Animal Nutrition</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Animal nutrition is the study of the dietary needs of animals, focusing on how different nutrients affect their growth, health, and productivity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      Just as people need a balanced diet to stay healthy, animals require a mix of nutrients to thrive.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Nutrients:</strong><br>
      Proteins: Essential for growth and muscle development.<br>
      Carbohydrates: Provide energy.<br>
      Fats: Serve as concentrated energy sources.<br>
      Vitamins and Minerals: Important for various bodily functions and overall health.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      For example, chickens require a balanced feed that includes grains (carbohydrates), soybean meal (proteins), and added vitamins to ensure they grow well and lay eggs consistently.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of animal nutrition like crafting a balanced meal plan for yourself. Just as you need the right mix of food groups to stay healthy, animals need a balanced diet to perform their best.

    <h4>Step 2: Feeding Practices and Strategies</h4>
    <p><strong>Feeding Methods:</strong><br>
      Feeding practices vary by species and production system. Some common methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad Libitum Feeding:</strong> Animals have constant access to feed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scheduled Feeding:</strong> Animals are fed at specific times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      In dairy farming, cows are often fed a mixture of forages and grains at scheduled intervals to optimize milk production and maintain digestive health.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Scheduled feeding is like having set meal times that help maintain a routine and ensure proper digestion and energy levels.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3: Maintaining Animal Health</h4>
    <p><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong><br>
      Regular health check-ups, vaccinations, and parasite control are crucial for preventing disease and promoting well-being.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Farmers often monitor the weight, behavior, and milk production of dairy cows as indicators of overall health. If a cow shows a decline in milk yield, it might signal an underlying health issue that needs attention.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Keeping animals healthy is like regularly servicing your carâ€”routine maintenance prevents breakdowns and keeps everything running smoothly.
