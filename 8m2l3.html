    <h3>Lesson 2.3: Political Science – Governance &amp; Policy</h3>
    <p>Political science studies how societies are governed and how policies are made. It explores the distribution and exercise of power, the roles of institutions, and the behavior of political actors.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Political Science?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Political science is the study of government systems, political activity, and the analysis of political behavior.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It’s like learning the “rules and strategies” of running a country.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a school where there is a student council (government) that makes decisions about activities, rules, and resource allocation. Political science studies how these decisions are made and how they affect the whole school (society).
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Key Concepts in Governance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Government Systems:</strong><br>
        Different forms of government (e.g., democracy, authoritarianism) determine how power is distributed.
        <br><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> In a democracy, leaders are elected by the people, and policies are shaped by public opinion. In contrast, an authoritarian regime may concentrate power in the hands of a few.
        <br><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of government systems like different team strategies in a sports game—some teams work together democratically, while others rely on a strong leader to make quick decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Policy Making:</strong><br>
        Policies are rules and guidelines created by governments to address public issues.
        <br><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> Environmental policies, such as limits on air pollution, are created based on scientific research and public input to protect health and nature.
        <br><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine policy making as crafting a set of instructions for a group project—everyone has a role, and the guidelines help ensure that the project runs smoothly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h4>Step 3: Political Behavior and Power Dynamics</h4>
    <p><strong>Political Behavior:</strong><br>
      This area studies how people participate in politics, including voting, protests, and public opinion.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Election studies show how factors like media, economic conditions, and social networks influence voter behavior.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of political behavior like a marketplace where different ideas and opinions are exchanged, and the most persuasive “products” (policies) gain popularity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Power and Authority:</strong><br>
      Political science examines how power is gained, used, and sometimes abused.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      The balance of power between different branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) is designed to prevent any one group from becoming too dominant.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a balanced seesaw where weight is evenly distributed to ensure that no single side can overpower the other.
