    <h3>Lesson 2.2: Livestock Production &amp; Management</h3>
    <p>Livestock production involves raising animals for food, fiber, and other products. In this lesson, we explore how animals are bred, raised, and managed to ensure healthy production and sustainable farming.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: Basics of Livestock Production</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Livestock production is the practice of raising animals such as cattle, pigs, chickens, and sheep for meat, milk, eggs, and other products.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like managing a farm where animals are cared for, nurtured, and grown for the products they provide.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong><br>
      Housing: Providing safe and comfortable living spaces for animals.<br>
      Feeding: Ensuring animals receive the proper nutrition.<br>
      Health Care: Regular veterinary check-ups and disease prevention.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of a livestock farm as a well-run home where every family member (animal) is provided with a proper home, nutritious food, and healthcare to thrive.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Livestock Breeding and Genetics</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Similar to plants, animal breeding is the process of selecting animals with desirable traits to produce better offspring.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like choosing the best pets to breed, aiming for traits such as growth rate, fertility, and disease resistance.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Techniques:</strong><br>
      Selective Breeding: Choosing animals that excel in certain traits, like high milk production or rapid growth.<br>
      Crossbreeding: Mixing different breeds to combine their strengths, for example, breeding two different types of cattle to produce offspring that are both hardy and high-yielding.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    In dairy farming, cows are bred to enhance milk yield and quality. Over time, selective breeding has produced cows that produce more milk with better nutritional content.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine selecting the best players for a sports team. Over time, by choosing the best athletes, you build a stronger team—similarly, selective breeding improves the overall quality of livestock.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Management Practices for Livestock Health</h4>
    <p><strong>Health and Welfare:</strong><br>
    Good management practices ensure that animals remain healthy, which in turn leads to better productivity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Practices:</strong><br>
      Nutrition: Providing a balanced diet that meets the specific needs of different animals.
      <br><strong>Example:</strong> Dairy cows require diets rich in energy and protein to maximize milk production.<br>
      Disease Prevention: Vaccinations, regular check-ups, and proper sanitation help prevent outbreaks.<br>
      Stress Reduction: Maintaining a low-stress environment is crucial, as stress can reduce immunity and productivity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Managing livestock is like caring for a family. You need to feed, protect, and create a calm environment for your children (animals) so they grow up healthy and strong.
