    <h3>Lesson 3.2: Anthropology – Culture, Identity &amp; Rituals</h3>
    <p>Anthropology is the study of humans and their cultures. In this lesson, we explore how culture shapes identity, influences behavior, and creates rituals that bond communities.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Anthropology?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Anthropology examines the cultural, social, and physical aspects of human beings across time and space.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It’s like studying the story of humanity—how people live, what they value, and how they interact.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine anthropology as a giant scrapbook that records the many ways people have lived and celebrated life throughout history.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Understanding Culture and Identity</h4>
    <p><strong>Culture:</strong><br>
      The shared beliefs, practices, languages, and customs of a group of people.</p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Consider the varied cultural practices around food—from the spicy curries of India to the pasta dishes of Italy. Each reflects the history, climate, and traditions of the people.</p>
    <p><strong>Identity:</strong><br>
      How individuals and groups see themselves, often shaped by their culture.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
      National identity can be seen in symbols like flags, traditional dress, and national holidays.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of culture as a quilt, with each patch representing different traditions and values that, when sewn together, form the unique identity of a community.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: The Role of Rituals</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Rituals are repeated actions or ceremonies that hold symbolic meaning and reinforce cultural values.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      Rituals are like traditions passed down through generations.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Wedding ceremonies, religious festivals, and graduation ceremonies are all rituals that help mark important transitions in life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine rituals as bookmarks in the story of a culture—each one marking a significant chapter and helping people remember and celebrate their shared history.
