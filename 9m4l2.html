    <h3>Lesson 4.2: Agricultural Economics &amp; Policy</h3>
    <p>Agricultural economics and policy study how resources are allocated in the farming sector and how laws and regulations affect agricultural practices. This lesson explains how economic principles and policy decisions shape global agriculture.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Agricultural Economics?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Agricultural economics examines the production, distribution, and consumption of agricultural goods and services, and the economic decisions of farmers and governments.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like managing a household budget but on a much larger scale, covering entire farms and even whole countries.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong><br>
      Supply and Demand: How the availability of crops and consumer needs affect prices.<br>
      Market Structures: The organization of markets, from small family farms to large agribusinesses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    When a drought reduces crop yields, the supply decreases, and prices typically rise, affecting both farmers and consumers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine a small bakery that suddenly runs out of flour—the scarcity drives up the cost of bread. In agriculture, similar economic principles determine food prices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: The Role of Agricultural Policy</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Agricultural policy involves laws and regulations that govern farming practices, trade, subsidies, and food safety.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    Think of policy as the rulebook for the farming community—it sets guidelines that help ensure fair practices and sustainable use of resources.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    Subsidies for organic farming or restrictions on pesticide use are examples of policies that influence how farming is done.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Consider agricultural policy as the instructions on a recipe that not only tell you what to do but also help you avoid mistakes—ensuring the final dish (the food supply) is both high quality and produced fairly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Global Trade and Food Security</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition of Food Security:</strong><br>
    Food security means that all people have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs over time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s ensuring that everyone, everywhere, can get the food they need without shortages.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    International trade agreements can help stabilize food prices and supply by allowing countries to import crops when domestic production is low.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of global trade as a community potluck where different households share dishes. If one household runs out, others can contribute to make sure everyone has enough to eat.
