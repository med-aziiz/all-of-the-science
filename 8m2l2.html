    <h3>Lesson 2.2: Psychology – Human Behavior &amp; Cognition</h3>
    <p>Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior. It seeks to understand how individuals think, feel, and act, both on their own and in groups.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Psychology?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Psychology examines mental processes, emotions, and behaviors, and seeks to understand why we act the way we do.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It is like exploring the “inner workings” of the mind to see how it influences behavior.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of the mind as a computer. Psychology tries to understand its hardware (brain structure) and software (thought processes and emotions).

    <h4>Step 2: Key Areas of Human Behavior</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cognition:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cognition refers to mental processes such as thinking, memory, and problem-solving.</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> When you solve a puzzle, you use cognitive skills to analyze the problem, remember possible solutions, and decide on the best approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> It’s like a detective using clues (memories and thoughts) to solve a mystery.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emotion:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Emotions are feelings that influence our actions and decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> Feeling happy can boost creativity and motivation, while fear might trigger a fight-or-flight response.</p>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Emotions are like the color filters on a camera, changing the way you see the world and influencing your reactions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Behavior:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Social behavior is how we interact with others, including cooperation, competition, and communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> Group projects in school show how individuals work together (or sometimes clash) to achieve a common goal.</p>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine an orchestra where every musician must listen and adjust to each other to perform a harmonious piece.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: How Psychological Processes Affect Everyday Life</h4>
    <p><strong>Impact on Decision-Making:</strong><br>
      Our thoughts and emotions greatly influence the choices we make, from daily routines to major life decisions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Stress (a psychological response) can affect sleep, eating habits, and even physical health.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Consider the mind as a steering wheel. How you turn it (your thoughts and feelings) determines the direction your life takes.
