    <h3>Lesson 4.2: Social Justice & Inequality</h3>
    <p>Social justice is about fairness in the way people are treated, and inequality refers to the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges among different groups. In this lesson, we will explore the roots of social inequality and discuss efforts to promote justice and equity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Social Justice?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Social justice involves creating a society where all individuals have equal access to resources and opportunities, and where everyone is treated fairly.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It means making sure that no one is unfairly left out or treated badly because of their background.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a classroom where every student gets an equal chance to participate and succeed—this is the goal of social justice.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Understanding Inequality</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition of Inequality:</strong><br>
      Inequality occurs when resources and opportunities are distributed unevenly across different groups in society.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Types of Inequality:</strong><br>
      Economic Inequality: Differences in income and wealth.<br>
      Social Inequality: Differences in access to education, healthcare, and social services.<br>
      Political Inequality: Disparities in political power and participation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Economic inequality can be seen in the gap between the wealthiest and poorest citizens within a country, often measured by indicators like the Gini coefficient (a statistical measure of distribution).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of inequality as a pie that is not divided fairly—some people get a large slice, while others get only a small piece.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Efforts to Promote Social Justice</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policies and Programs:</strong><br>
          Governments and organizations work to reduce inequality through policies like progressive taxation (taxes that increase with income) and social welfare programs.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong><br>
          Universal healthcare and free education initiatives aim to provide equal access to essential services.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Social Movements:</strong><br>
          Grassroots movements and advocacy groups often push for changes in laws and societal norms to ensure fairness.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong><br>
          The civil rights movement fought for equal rights regardless of race, leading to significant legal and social reforms.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of social justice efforts as a community coming together to redistribute resources more evenly, like sharing a large pizza so that everyone gets a fair slice.
