    <h3>Lesson 4.1: Globalization &amp; Social Change</h3>
    <p>Globalization is the process of increased interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. It affects our cultures, economies, and social structures in many ways.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Globalization?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Globalization refers to the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade, investment, and communication.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      Think of globalization as the world becoming a smaller neighborhood, where ideas, goods, and people move freely across borders.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a potluck dinner where everyone brings a dish from their own culture. As you taste different foods, you experience a blend of flavors from around the world.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: How Globalization Drives Social Change</h4>
    <p><strong>Economic Integration:</strong><br>
      As markets become interconnected, businesses expand internationally, affecting jobs, income levels, and local economies.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      A company in one country may outsource production to another country where labor is less expensive, influencing both countries’ economic conditions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong><br>
      Globalization facilitates the sharing of cultural practices, ideas, and values. This can lead to both cultural enrichment and cultural homogenization.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
      International films, music, and food introduce people to new traditions, while global brands like fast food chains also spread similar tastes across different regions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Social Movements:</strong><br>
      The ease of communication allows social movements (organized efforts to create social change) to spread quickly across borders.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
      Movements for environmental protection or human rights can gain support from people around the world through social media.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Globalization is like a giant, interconnected web where a change in one part of the network can influence many others, similar to how a trend on social media can quickly become global.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Challenges and Opportunities</h4>
    <p><strong>Opportunities:</strong><br>
      Globalization can lead to economic growth, cultural diversity, and shared technological advancements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>
      It may also lead to job displacement, cultural erosion, and increased inequality if the benefits are not evenly distributed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong><br>
      Countries may work together on issues like climate change and international trade agreements, while also addressing domestic challenges such as protecting local industries and cultural heritage.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of globalization as a double-edged sword—it can cut both ways, offering both benefits and challenges that need careful balancing.
