    <h3>Lesson 4.1: Sustainable Farming &amp; Organic Practices</h3>
    <p>Sustainable farming means growing crops and raising animals in ways that protect the environment, conserve resources, and maintain soil health over the long term. Organic practices avoid synthetic chemicals and promote natural processes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Sustainable Farming?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Sustainable farming is a method of agriculture that aims to produce food in a way that is environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially responsible.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like planning a meal where you not only care about taste but also about the health of your ingredients and the kitchen for future meals.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Goals:</strong><br>
      Environmental Protection: Reducing chemical use, preserving water and soil.<br>
      Economic Viability: Ensuring farms remain profitable over time.<br>
      Social Responsibility: Supporting local communities and fair labor practices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: Organic Practices in Agriculture</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Organic farming avoids synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), focusing on natural growth processes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    Imagine growing a garden using only natural compost, beneficial insects, and crop rotation (changing the crops grown in a field over time to maintain soil health).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    Many organic farmers use compost (decomposed organic matter that enriches soil) and cover crops (plants grown to protect and enrich the soil when main crops are not planted) to maintain soil fertility.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of organic farming as cooking with fresh, local ingredients rather than processed foods—everything is natural and designed to work in harmony with the environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Real-World Benefits</h4>
    <p><strong>Improved Soil Health:</strong><br>
    Sustainable practices build organic matter in the soil, improving its structure and fertility.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Water Conservation:</strong><br>
    Techniques like drip irrigation (delivering water directly to plant roots) minimize water waste.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Biodiversity:</strong><br>
    By avoiding harmful chemicals, sustainable farms support a wide range of plant and animal life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Just as a well-maintained garden attracts a variety of butterflies and bees, sustainable farms foster ecosystems that benefit both nature and agriculture.
