    <h3>Lesson 3.1: Economics – Markets, Trade &amp; Finance</h3>
    <p>Economics is the study of how people make choices about using limited resources, and it helps us understand markets, trade, and finance. In this lesson, we explore basic economic ideas, how markets work, and the role of trade and finance in shaping societies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Economics?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Economics examines how individuals, businesses, and governments decide what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets the products.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      Think of economics as learning how people manage money and resources, much like planning a household budget.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine you have a jar of cookies that you must share among friends. Economics is like deciding how many cookies each friend gets, considering that there are only so many cookies (limited resources).
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: How Markets Work</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition of a Market:</strong><br>
      A market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to exchange goods, services, or information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong><br>
      <strong>Supply and Demand:</strong><br>
      Supply: How much of a product is available.<br>
      Demand: How much people want that product.<br>
      (Simple Explanation: When more people want something and there is less of it, the price tends to rise.)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Price Mechanism:</strong><br>
      Prices adjust based on the balance of supply and demand.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Consider a local farmers' market:<br>
      If there is a large harvest of apples (high supply) and not as many buyers (low demand), apple prices will fall.<br>
      Conversely, if there are few apples (low supply) but many people want them (high demand), prices will rise.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of a seesaw where one side represents supply and the other represents demand. When one side changes, the balance (price) shifts accordingly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Trade and Global Markets</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition of Trade:</strong><br>
      Trade is the exchange of goods and services between individuals or countries.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It’s like swapping items with friends—if you have extra apples and your friend has extra oranges, you might trade to get both.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Countries trade goods they produce well (like Brazil trading coffee) for goods that are scarce in their region (like Japan trading electronics).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a group of neighbors each with different skills—one bakes bread, another grows vegetables, and another fixes cars. By trading, everyone gets what they need without having to do everything themselves.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 4: Finance and Money</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition of Finance:</strong><br>
      Finance deals with the management of money, investments, and credit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It is the study of how money flows in an economy and how people and businesses plan for the future.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong><br>
      Banks and Loans: Banks store money and lend it to people who need it (like borrowing to buy a house).<br>
      Investments: People invest money to earn a profit over time.<br>
      Stock Markets: Platforms where shares of companies are bought and sold.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      When you invest in a company by buying its stock, you own a small part of it. If the company grows, the value of your stock may increase, providing you with a profit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of finance as managing your personal savings and investments, like planning how to save money for a big purchase or for your future—just on a much larger, organized scale for entire economies.
