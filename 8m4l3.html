    <h3>Lesson 4.3: Technology’s Impact on Society</h3>
    <p>Technology has a profound impact on every aspect of modern life, shaping how we communicate, work, and interact with one another. In this lesson, we explore how technology influences social structures and contributes to both progress and challenges in society.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: How Technology Changes Communication</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Technology, such as the internet and mobile devices, has transformed the way people communicate and share information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It’s like having a telephone that can also send pictures, videos, and even real-time messages to anyone around the world.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Social media platforms allow people to connect across continents, share their lives instantly, and mobilize social movements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a global town square where everyone can speak and listen at the same time—that’s what modern communication technology creates.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Impact on Work and Economy</h4>
    <p><strong>Economic Transformation:</strong><br>
      Technology has reshaped industries, created new job opportunities, and even disrupted traditional business models.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the nature of work, leading to the creation of new fields while rendering some traditional jobs obsolete.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of technology as a powerful engine that can drive economic growth, but if not managed well, it can also leave some drivers (workers) behind.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Social and Cultural Changes</h4>
    <p><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong><br>
      Technology enables rapid cultural exchange, influencing fashion, music, and lifestyles globally.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Streaming services bring diverse cultural content into our homes, exposing us to new languages, traditions, and art forms.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Digital Divide:</strong><br>
      However, unequal access to technology (known as the digital divide) can widen existing social inequalities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a library that only some people can access because of its location—while others remain uninformed. Technology can either bridge or widen these gaps, depending on how it is distributed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 4: Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong><br>
          As technology advances, issues of data privacy and cybersecurity become more critical.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong><br>
          Personal data breaches can lead to identity theft and loss of privacy.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Use:</strong><br>
          There are important ethical questions about the use of technology in areas like surveillance, AI decision-making, and digital rights.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of technology as a tool that can be used for great good or harm. Like a sharp knife, it requires careful handling and clear guidelines to ensure it is used safely and ethically.
