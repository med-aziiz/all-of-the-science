    <h3>Lesson 3.3: Geography – Human-Environment Interaction</h3>
    <p>Geography is the study of the Earth's landscapes, environments, and the relationships between people and their environments. This lesson focuses on how human activities affect the natural world and vice versa.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Geography?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Geography examines the physical features of the Earth and how people interact with these features.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
      It’s like looking at a map to understand both the land and how people live on it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of geography as the study of a giant neighborhood, where you learn about the houses (cities), parks (natural areas), and the roads (transportation systems) that connect them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: Human-Environment Interaction</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      This area of geography studies how human activities modify the natural environment and how the environment, in turn, influences human life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Urbanization (the growth of cities) can lead to the loss of green spaces and increased pollution, while also providing opportunities for economic growth.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Imagine a small town that grows into a big city. As the town expands, it changes the surrounding landscape—farmlands may give way to buildings, and natural water bodies may be altered to accommodate new roads.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Environmental Impact and Sustainability</h4>
    <p><strong>Concept of Sustainability:</strong><br>
      Sustainability means using resources in a way that does not harm the environment or deplete resources for future generations.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
      Sustainable farming practices, like crop rotation and organic farming, help preserve soil health and reduce environmental pollution.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
      Think of sustainability like managing a family budget for the long term—you plan carefully to ensure that there is enough for today and the future.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong><br>
      Policies on recycling, renewable energy, and conservation efforts all stem from geographic studies of how human activities impact the environment.
