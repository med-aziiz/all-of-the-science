    <h3>Lesson 3.3: Biotechnology in Agriculture</h3>
    <p>Biotechnology in agriculture involves using biological processes, genetic information, and molecular tools to develop improved crops and farming practices.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Biotechnology in Agriculture?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Biotechnology in agriculture applies biological techniques to improve plant and animal health, increase crop yields, and enhance nutritional value.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like using modern science to make plants and animals better suited to our needs.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine upgrading a computer’s software to boost its performance—agricultural biotechnology upgrades crops and livestock to perform better.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 2: Techniques in Agricultural Biotechnology</h4>
    <p><strong>Genetic Engineering:</strong><br>
    Directly modifying the DNA of crops to introduce desirable traits such as drought tolerance, pest resistance, or enhanced nutritional content.
    <br><strong>Example:</strong> Bt corn is genetically modified to produce a protein that is toxic to certain pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
    <br><strong>Brief Explanation:</strong> (Bt stands for Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium whose genes are used to protect the plant from insects.)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Marker-Assisted Selection:</strong><br>
    Using genetic markers (specific DNA sequences that indicate a trait) to select plants with favorable traits more quickly.
    <br><strong>Example:</strong> This technique can help breeders identify which wheat plants are most likely to be disease-resistant.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tissue Culture:</strong><br>
    Growing plants from small tissue samples in a controlled environment, ensuring uniformity and rapid propagation.
    <br><strong>Analogy:</strong> Tissue culture is like cloning a favorite plant so that you get many identical copies without waiting for seeds to grow.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Impact and Benefits</h4>
    <p><strong>Improved Crop Performance:</strong><br>
    Biotechnology can lead to crops that are more resilient to environmental stress, have higher yields, and are more nutritious.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong><br>
    By reducing the need for chemical inputs (like pesticides and fertilizers), biotechnology can help make agriculture more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
    Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice variety designed to produce beta-carotene (a precursor to vitamin A) to help combat vitamin A deficiency in developing countries.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of biotechnology as a tool for upgrading nature’s own designs—similar to enhancing a basic smartphone into a high-performance device with new features.
