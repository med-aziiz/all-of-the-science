    <h3>Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Social Theories</h3>
    <p>Social theories are frameworks that help us explain how societies work and why people behave the way they do.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Are Social Theories?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Social theories are ideas and explanations that help us understand and predict social behavior and the organization of society.</p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    Think of social theories as the lenses through which we view societyâ€”each lens highlights different aspects of human behavior and social structures.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine trying on different pairs of glasses that change the way you see the world; each pair represents a different social theory.</p>

    <h4>Step 2: Major Social Theories</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Structural Functionalism:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This theory views society as a complex system with interdependent parts, each serving a function to maintain stability. (Example: Institutions like family, education, and government work together like organs in a body to keep society healthy.)</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> In a community, schools (education) help prepare young people for work, while the legal system (government) ensures rules are followed, all contributing to social order.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conflict Theory:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This theory sees society as a battleground of competing groups, where power and resources are unequally distributed. (Example: Social conflicts, such as those between rich and poor, drive changes in society.)</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> The struggle over economic resources can lead to movements that seek to change unequal systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Symbolic Interactionism:</strong>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This theory focuses on the everyday interactions between people and the meanings they attach to these interactions. (Example: How personal interactions and communication shape our identities and social norms.)</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong> The way a greeting, like a handshake, is interpreted can vary across cultures and influences social relationships.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Why Social Theories Matter</h4>
    <p><strong>Understanding Society:</strong><br>
    Social theories help us understand the patterns and problems in society, guiding research and public policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong><br>
    They inform decisions in education, healthcare, and government policy by highlighting underlying social dynamics.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Just as a map helps you navigate through a complex city, social theories help you understand the complex layout of society.</p>
