    <h3>Lesson 4.3: Food Security &amp; Environmental Challenges</h3>
    <p>Food security and environmental challenges are closely linked. This lesson examines how agricultural practices affect the environment and what challenges must be overcome to ensure a stable food supply for the future.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 1: What Is Food Security?</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    Food security exists when all people have reliable access to enough food for an active and healthy life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong><br>
    It’s like making sure every family in a neighborhood has enough groceries, regardless of changes in supply or price.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Issues:</strong><br>
      Availability: Are there enough food resources?<br>
      Accessibility: Can people get the food they need?<br>
      Utilization: Is the food nutritious and safe?<br>
      Stability: Are these factors consistent over time?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Food security is like having a well-stocked pantry that never runs out, even during tough times.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Environmental Challenges in Agriculture</h4>
    <p><strong>Major Issues:</strong><br>
      Climate Change: Alters growing seasons and can lead to extreme weather conditions.<br>
      Soil Degradation: Overuse and poor management can reduce soil fertility.<br>
      Water Scarcity: Limited water resources affect crop production.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    In many regions, climate change has led to prolonged droughts, reducing crop yields and threatening the livelihoods of farmers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Imagine trying to grow a garden during a long, dry spell—without enough water, even the best soil and seeds will struggle to produce a good harvest.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Step 3: Strategies for Sustainable Food Security</h4>
    <p><strong>Innovative Farming Techniques:</strong><br>
    Precision agriculture and sustainable practices can help maximize yields while protecting the environment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Policy and International Cooperation:</strong><br>
    Policies that promote resource conservation, support small farmers, and encourage sustainable practices are essential for global food security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong><br>
    Programs that support conservation agriculture (farming methods that reduce soil erosion and water loss) help maintain soil health and ensure long-term productivity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
    Think of these strategies as long-term budgeting for a household—by planning carefully and making smart choices, you ensure that you can weather economic or environmental challenges without running out of resources.
